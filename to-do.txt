Pipe17 Summer 2020 Internship Frontend Homework
We are interested in creating a browser based file system, functionally similar to Google Drive or Dropboxâ€™s web interface, or to a folder browsing structure you might find on a Windows or macOS device.

A user should be able to:

- Create folders and subfolders,
- Create files in the folders, (files are just an item with name)
- View the list contents of a folder,
- Delete folders and files,
- Rename folders and files.

Frontend: We would like this file system created using React as the front-end framework. We expect the project to follow the latest React best practices for code organization. Here are some resources for you to get started:
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
https://react-bootstrap.github.io/

Bonus: Deploy the project onto the cloud
Bonus: Save the data locally so close the browser will not lose the created files and folders
Bonus: Save the data on server side
